TODO: Most comments in this class are instructive and should be deleted after the source is implemented.

This file provides a stubbed example of how to use the Airbyte CDK to develop both a source connector which supports full refresh or and an
incremental syncs from an HTTP API.

The various TODOs are both implementation hints and steps - fulfilling all the TODOs should be sufficient to implement one basic and one incremental
stream from a source. This pattern is the same one used by Airbyte internally to implement connectors.

The approach here is not authoritative, and devs are free to use their own judgement.

There are additional required TODOs in the files within the integration_tests folder and the spec.yaml file.

# Basic full refresh stream
class TheGraphStream(HttpStream, ABC):
    """
    TODO remove this comment

    This class represents a stream output by the connector.
    This is an abstract base class meant to contain all the common functionality at the API level e.g: the API base URL, pagination strategy,
    parsing responses etc..

    Each stream should extend this class (or another abstract subclass of it) to specify behavior unique to that stream.

    Typically for REST APIs each stream corresponds to a resource in the API. For example if the API
    contains the endpoints
        - GET v1/customers
        - GET v1/employees

    then you should have three classes:
    `class TheGraphStream(HttpStream, ABC)` which is the current class
    `class Customers(TheGraphStream)` contains behavior to pull data for customers using v1/customers
    `class Employees(TheGraphStream)` contains behavior to pull data for employees using v1/employees

    If some streams implement incremental sync, it is typical to create another class
    `class IncrementalTheGraphStream((TheGraphStream), ABC)` then have concrete stream implementations extend it. An example
    is provided below.

    See the reference docs for the full list of configurable options.

        to most other methods in this class to help you form headers, request bodies, query params, etc..

        For example, if the API accepts a 'page' parameter to determine which page of the result to return, and a response from the API contains a
        'page' number, then this method should probably return a dict {'page': response.json()['page'] + 1} to increment the page count by 1.
